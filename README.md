# Real-Time Weather Dashboard Project

## Objective
Build a real-time weather dashboard that displays current weather conditions for a specific location and provides additional features such as forecasts, alerts, and historical data.

## Steps

1. **Choose a Weather API:**
   - Select a weather API provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Weatherbit).
   - Sign up for an API key for authentication.

2. **Fetch Current Weather Data:**
   - Use the API to retrieve the current weather conditions for a specific city or location.
   - Display key information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.

3. **Implement Forecasting:**
   - Extend your application to provide a weather forecast for the upcoming days.
   - Display forecasted temperatures, conditions, and any additional relevant data.

4. **Alerts for Extreme Weather:**
   - Implement an alerting system for extreme weather conditions (storms, temperature extremes).
   - Send notifications or display warnings on the dashboard.

5. **Historical Weather Data:**
   - Explore the API's capabilities for retrieving historical weather data.
   - Display historical trends, averages, or specific events on your dashboard.

6. **Geolocation Support:**
   - Allow users to input locations manually or through geolocation.
   - Incorporate interactive maps to visualize weather patterns.

7. **Visualizations:**
   - Create visualizations like graphs or charts to represent weather trends over time.
   - Use a plotting library (Matplotlib, Plotly) for graphical representation.

8. **User Preferences:**
   - Implement user preferences for temperature units (Celsius, Fahrenheit) and other settings.
   - Allow users to save their favorite locations.

9. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure your dashboard is responsive and works well on various devices, including mobile phones and tablets.

10. **Documentation and Comments:**
    - Document your code with clear explanations, especially for key functionalities.
    - Include comments to help others (and yourself) understand the code.
